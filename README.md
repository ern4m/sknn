## KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours)
This small repo in the implementation of a simple knn algorithm that classifies a point given some neighbours points.

### Setup
Clone the project (or just download and unpack the zip):
```bash
git clone git@github.com:ern4m/sknn.git
```
or
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ern4m/sknn.git
```
Enter the folder path:
```bash
cd ./sknn
```
Create the virtual enviroment:
```bash
python3 -m venv ./venv
```
Source the activate file to _activate_ the env. (do the similitar to your OS):
```bash
source ./venv/bin/activate
```
Once in the virtual enviroment install the project requirements:

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```
Now just run the main.py file:

```bash
python3 main.py
```
